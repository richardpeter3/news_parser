My first attempt at using GIT...

Matt - I realise I probably didn't comment enough I will go back and comment for you amigo.

THe general gist is that there are several types of object:

DatabaseAdministrator: A class to make talking to my Local Database easier
RssDBA - extends DatabaseAdminsitrator and adds functionality to parse RSS XMLs and add any links in them to the database
SpiderDBA - extends DatabaseAdminstrator and adds functionality for a spider

Controller - class for initialising and controling a web crawl
NewsCrwaler - Crawler object created by Controller which parses a webpage, enters a record into the database and saves an xml of the text locally for parsing later with some algorithm. Ideally the algo would run as the page is initialy retrieved but I need some news to test and develop it on.

RSSController - class for initialising and controlling a "crawler" to read RSS feeds.
RssCrwaler -  almost a clone of NewsCrawler but with some other functionality.
